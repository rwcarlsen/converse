* Each user can have a "conversations" directory in a standard location in
  their upspin tree.

* Each conversation thread is its own directory in the main "conversations"
  directory.

* Each message/reply in the conversation is a file named "msg1.txt",
  "msg2.txt", and so on.

* Edits/modifications to a message are "msg1.1.txt" for the 1st modified
  revision version of message 1, "msg1.2.txt" for the 2nd modified revision
  and so on.

* Participants in a conversation are controlled by the upspin Access
  file.
